## ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS ## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Write a function that takes in a dataset as a parameter, and returns a table
# of aggregate information about it. It must perform a groupby operation to
# show a dimension of the dataset as grouped by a particular feature (column).
# We expect the included table to:
#   - Have well formatted column names
#   - Only contain relevant information
#   - Be intentionally sorted in a meaningful way
