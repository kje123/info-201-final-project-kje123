## The Problem
<!-- An introduction of the problem domain and dataset -->


## Summary Information
<!-- A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated
from the data and includes information calculated by your summary information
function -->


## Table
<!-- A table of aggregated data (e.g., that has been "grouped" by one of your
features) with pertinent observations found in it. # You must also describe why
you included the table, and what information it reveals.-->


## Charts
<!-- Three different charts that display information from the data (what you
visualize is up to you). Describe the purpose of each chart (e.g., "this chart
was intended to show the relationship between..."), render each chart, and
describe pertinent observations found in each chart. -->
