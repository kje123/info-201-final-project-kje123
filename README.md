# Final Project

# Our Domain Of Interest
For our project, we wanted to explore the field of environmental trends. All of our group members are concerned about environmental trends that we are seeing, and so we wanted to use data to talk about what exactly is happening with our planet's environment and answer some questions we were curious about. One particular issue we were all concerned about is the effects of climate change, and what factors may be contributing to it.

## Questions we want to answer
- In what ways does pollution factor into climate change?
- Using coral reef statistics as an example, how significant has the effect of climate change been over time?
- Does the amount of pollution in cities affect the temperature?
- In what direction are the temperatures of areas moving? Is this directly caused by any change in climate?
- At what scale (city, state, country) do changes in teperature become significant?
- Can we use our data to predict future trends with climate change?
