# Final Project

# Our Domain Of Interest
For our project, we wanted to explore the field of environmental trends. All of our group members are concerned about environmental trends that we are seeing, so we wanted to use data to talk and show about what exactly is happening with our planet's environment and answer some questions we were curious about. One particular issue we were all concerned about is the effects of climate change, and what factors may be contributing to it.

## Questions we want to answer
- In what ways does pollution factor into climate change?
- Using coral reef statistics as an example, how significant has the effect of climate change been over time?
- Does the amount of pollution in cities affect the temperature?
- In what direction are the temperatures of areas moving? Is this directly caused by any change in climate?
- At what scale (city, state, country) do changes in teperature become significant?
- Can we use our data to predict future trends with climate change?
- How do CO2 emissions compare for the US and the world? 
- How does income group compare to a country's emissions?
- Which countries have the largest growth in CO2 over time?

## Source Two: Global Coral Bleaching dataset
- Data scraped from the Harvard Database and hosted on the WorldFish Dataverse under Harvard Dataverse
- Data is a compilation of statistics on the coral bleaching phenomenon on a global scale (information was sourced from UNEP-WCMC, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), CoralList)
- 28 features, 6,190 rows

## Source Three: Global Land Temperatures dataset
- Data repackaged from a compilation put together from the Berkeley Earth section of the Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, and hosted on kaggle.com
- Data is a compilation of multiple sets that are sorted by scale (city, state, country, ect)
- 9 features, 3,193 rows

their income group
- CO2 emissions data: 59 features, 269 rows; income data: 5 features, 265 rows
